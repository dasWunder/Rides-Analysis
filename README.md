Hello, this is my second project for rides analysis

The "Rides analysis" project is done in Python in Jupyter Notebook, I used several libraries as well as in my first project https://github.com/dasWunder/Games-Analysis

The project also contains all the major steps: The task itself, data and metadata studying, data preprocessing, EDA, hypothesis testing, and conclusions. Each step has its conclusions to keep up
